# Common Lisp Highlighting & Support in Atom

An awesome package lovingly created to support proper syntax highlighting of
Common Lisp files.

This is *not* converted from the Textmate Bundle, and therefore does not have
the shortcomings of said bundle!

## TODO:
* Get Complex numbers `#c(5.0 3/2)` working properly.
* Remove a lot of the scheme/Racket-isms that are in the code, as I have use a *LOT*
  of their regexes to jump-start this work.
* Get `loop` and all of it's keywords working just fine.
* Set the read-macro regex, especially for pathnames
* Fix typing the single quote character `'` so it doesn't auto-fill a second one
* Other stuff I haven't thought of yet...
