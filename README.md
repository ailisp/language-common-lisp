# Common Lisp Highlighting & Support in Atom

An awesome package lovingly created to support proper syntax highlighting of Common Lisp files.

This is *not* converted from the Textmate Bundle, and therefore does not have the shortcomings of said bundle!

## TODO:
* Get Complex numbers `#c(5.0 3/2)` working properly.
